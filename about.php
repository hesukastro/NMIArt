                <p>A self taught abstract artist living in Manila, Philippines. Nadine Ibay has directed her emotion to fluid, spontaneous and lively art in her works, her style and craft are all a combination of her passion for colours and her ability to be an art alchemist. A fan of mythology, music, crystals and everything the natural world has to offer, she channels it into art. Her main priority in her works are bringing light and dark together to create complexity and harmonise duality in both worlds.
